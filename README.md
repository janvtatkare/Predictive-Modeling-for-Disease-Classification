## Introduction

The goal of this project is to classify different diseases based on a given dataset. We implemented various machine learning algorithms, evaluated their performances, and selected the best-performing model. Applied feature extraction, preprocessing, and classification techniques to identify patterns in clinical datasets. Optimized model performance through hyperparameter tuning and cross-validation to enhance predictive accuracy. The primary focus is on improving classification accuracy and making the model robust for real-world applications.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains features relevant to disease classification, including clinical data and symptoms. Due to privacy concerns, the dataset is not publicly available. However, similar datasets may be found in open health data repositories if you'd like to replicate this project.

## Project Structure

- `Predictive Modeling for Disease Classification.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing data analysis, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
- `README.md`: Documentation for the project.
- `requirements.txt`: List of dependencies required to run the project (if applicable).

## Model Training and Evaluation

The notebook explores various models, including:

- **Logistic Regression**
- **Decision Trees**
- **Random Forest**
- **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**
- **Neural Networks**

Each model was evaluated on metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score to determine the best-performing model for this classification problem.

## Usage

To replicate the analysis and experiment with different models:

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Predictive Modeling for Disease Classification.git
   cd Predictive Modeling for Disease Classification
   ```


2. Run the notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook "Predictive Modeling for Disease Classification"
   ```

## Results

The final model achieved a high classification accuracy, demonstrating its effectiveness for disease classification tasks. Detailed results and performance metrics are available in the notebook.
